Hope is always there,but you can say it is never there.

This is just like the way on ground:it becomes a way when people walk on it.

{{< note >}}

A few words of long-winded.
A sieged lion/code farmer running for survival in the metropolis, perfection is the basic requirement for code. (**Once**)

Quiet appearance hides a heart of "revolutionary rebellion", not afraid of the secular view dare to break through the bondage, like to pursue the real freedom. 
With a dream in my heart, hoping to make it come true one day. 

Thanks All!
