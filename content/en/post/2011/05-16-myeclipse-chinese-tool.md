There are millions of languages and words in the world, but always feel that our square Chinese characters are better looking and more meaningful. And in the field of computers have been dominated by foreign countries, so many computers are the program in English version, sometimes it is really not convenient to use, so there is a large number of Chinese version of the program, these programs have been favored by the Chinese people.

The most commonly used IDEs in the JAVA world are 'Eclipse'and'MyEclisep',both of which are developed by foreigners, so it's no wonder that the IDE interfaceis in English. As another up-and-comer'Netbeans'development tool I think is more popular with domestic  programming beginners, why? Quite simply, its interface Chinese. 

Or first back to our theme today's'MyEclisep' Hanhuaprogram, 'Eclipse' Hanhua need  not say more, they go directly to the official website to download a language pack to achieve the Chinese interface, but 'MyEclipse' is not so simple, previously found a cow man wrote Hanhua package on the Internet, the trial effect is good, but the steps are a bit troublesome, last night suddenly wonder if you can do a fool's Hanhua program? Think of want to think that the feasibility of about 70%, the final measure or decide CODE, and finally in about 3 hours after the success of this Chinese program, the interface effect is as follows:

If you feel the need to download a go back to use it, here's how to use this software:

:: Directly unzip the downloaded compression package, remember not to break the directory structure or you will not be able to Hanhua, double-click 'MyEclipse' Hanhua software (transparent) .exe (this requires the latest version of JDK) or 'MyEclipse' Hanhua software (no transparency) .exe;

:: Browse and select the 'Common' directory under the 'MyEclipse' installation root, depending on where you install it;

:: Browse and select the 'bundles.info' (plug-in-specified) file, which  is listed under the 'MyEclipse

:: Browse and select the 'myeclipse .ini' files, some of which are called 'MyEclipse' . .. 'Directory; .

:: After clicking the Start Hanhua button, if successful, the following success prompt will appear, now you restart the next 'MyEclipse' program to see, preferably with the '-clean' command;

Take a look at the 'MyEclipse' interface after Hanhua:

May be because the Hanhua package is a bit old original, so it is not completely Hanhua, if you have a better Hanhua bag, I hope you can share with you. Finally, if you feel that the effect of Hanhua is not ideal and want to restore the English interface, just restore the corresponding folder directory under the 'bundles_backup.info' and 'myeclipse_backup.ini' file restart under the 'MyEclipse' software on it. 

Well, hanhua work is over here, now everyone wants to say something to follow the post to shoot bricks.
