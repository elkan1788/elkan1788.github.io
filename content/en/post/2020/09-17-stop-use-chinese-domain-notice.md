From today, 'lisenhui.cn' will be officially launched as the unique domain name for this blog space. 

In the morning received a notification text message from the domain name service provider, suggesting that the domain name needs to be renewed. Only found that unknowingly, the original work after the registration of the first domain name, has accompanied themselves through 7 years. At that time, Chinese the domain name is more special, and then on their own name registered '李森辉.cn'sdomain name.
