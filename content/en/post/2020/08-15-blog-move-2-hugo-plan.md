Recently found that their personal blog space suddenly ind accessible, after a check found that the original is the previous use of page service providers have stopped providing services. I had no choice but to relocate back to Github  Pages. But that's the development environment that's been re-prepared for Hexo, and it's going to take a hard time debugging to be successful. And just then on the Internet have seen Hugo static site  engine article, a Go language-based development of the extremely fast framework, development environment deployment is also simple and fast. In addition, the original domain name is also about to expire, just together to organize the blog space.

Visit Hugo's official website and look through the official documents, which are actually easier to use. But when you browse an existing topic, you don't   find the NexT theme you're using in your blog space, does that mean you're going to have to do it all over again! 

But it's good to finally find someone in Github  who has transplanted the Hexo  NexT theme:"Hugo-theme-next" (https://github.com/xtfly/hugo-theme-next), so the subsequent migration plan is based on this, and the overall thinking and plan is as follows:

Considering that they are all done in their spare time, the timeline is longer and I don't know if the problems encountered can be solved smoothly. No matter how much you do, everything has to have a Flag first, follow-up efforts to achieve Flag is good.
