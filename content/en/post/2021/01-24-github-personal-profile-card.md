There's always something new on    Github, and it's not unwittingly an interesting game to play with as a personal developer's lettercard. The effect is as follows:

It's not cumbersome to operate, as was the case with previous pages services, just prepare a specific repository, as follows:

## 1. Apply for a public warehouse

Apply for a public repository with the same name as your user name on Github, and you'll find a "praise" prompt from Github that reads:

Once the repository is created, a 'README.md' file is prepared by default, and you can then write the relevant information on it. 

Personal introduction information

Next up is you'll add personal information to 'README.md', write with standard markdown grammar editing, and support a variety of emoticons to add anything you want. By the way, you can use the Github API to present your own repository-related code submission, quality, hitting, and more, with an opening introduction. 

## 3. Example

Their own simple writing, only for you to see the reference, ha.
