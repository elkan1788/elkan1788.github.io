Welcome to the User Guide of `Hugo NexT` ！！！

## Hugo theme of NexT

`Next` is an elegant and powerful theme. It originated from `Hexo ` engine and is loved by many people. Thanks for [xtfly](https://github.com/xtfly/hugo-theme-next) clone it first, but it's a pity that the author didn't update it continuously later.

In order to let the `NexT` theme continue to shine on the `Hugo` high-performance static site engine. Through in-depth optimization and transformation in my spare time, I maintained the original simple and simple tone of `NexT`, and added many service components related to blog ecology to make the theme more perfect and easy to use.

- Integrate multiple comment plug-ins
- Add articles for quick sharing
- Support article access statistics

- Improve the "Hugo next" theme instruction manual
- Personal blog rapid deployment script
- Continue to optimize and improve the loading efficiency of the page
- Enhance black theme effect
- Follow the update of 'next' Official theme and migrate synchronously

Thanks for your pay attention and provide more suggestions!
