&lt;p>After some consideration or moving your personal blog from the Hexo engine to the Hugo engine, the blog theme is still NexT. In fact, I was worried about tossing up a brand new blog theme, and then I saw the &amp;ldquo;NexT&amp;rdquo;(&lt;a href="https://github.com/xtfly/hugo-theme-next">https://github.com/xtfly/hugo-theme-next&lt;/a>) theme shared by Lanlings on Github and quotedit directly. However, after deployment, there are areas that need to be improved, and the process of retrofitting optimization is documented here.
