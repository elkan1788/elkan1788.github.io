&lt;p>The &lt;code>NexT&lt;/code> theme has been optimized and shared in GitHub repository since last time [&lt;strong>hugo-theme-next&lt;/strong>]（ &lt;a href="https://github.com/elkan1788/hugo-theme-next">https://github.com/elkan1788/hugo-theme-next&lt;/a> ）After, it has also been used and email feedback by many &lt;code>NexT&lt;/code> theme lovers. So I decided to take some effort to maintain it, so I rejoined some of my previous ideas into the theme of &lt;code>NexT&lt;/code>, and updated the functions of some plug-ins at the same time.
The version code released after this optimization is `3.X', because the overall structure and previous changes are relatively large (mainly reflected in the configuration). Therefore, the relevant introduction of the theme and other information are also rewritten. At present, it is applying to be added to the official theme list (&lt;a href="https://deploy-preview-73--hugothemes.netlify.app/themes/hugo-theme-next/">click preview&lt;/a>), welcome your use and feedback.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The process of optimizing the Hugo Next theme</title><link>https://lisenhui.cn/en/2020/10/02/make-next-theme-pithy.html</link><pubDate>Fri, 02 Oct 2020 10:32:51 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://lisenhui.cn/en/2020/10/02/make-next-theme-pithy.html</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="1-background">1.

&lt;p>After some consideration or moving your personal blog from the Hexo engine to the Hugo engine, the blog theme is still NexT. In fact, I was worried about tossing up a brand new blog theme, and then I saw the &amp;ldquo;NexT&amp;rdquo;(&lt;a href="https://github.com/xtfly/hugo-theme-next">https://github.com/xtfly/hugo-theme-next&lt;/a>) theme shared by Lanlings on Github and quotedit directly. However, after deployment, there are areas that need to be improved, and the process of retrofitting optimization is documented here. If you also like this topic, then welcome to use, also welcome to exchange feedback.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
