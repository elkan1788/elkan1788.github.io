Searched some resources on the Internet, learned that JAVA write serial communication is quite a lot, then began to prepare for the development of debugging environment. Software program development environment is not a problem, but this hardware environment is a bit difficult. Not to mention their own use of notebook where to string ah, and if you really take this string of hardware to their own will not make, then thought of the virtual machine, think this thing should also have a virtual bar, really with their own guesses as there is really this thing, by the way also downloaded a string of small assistant for debugging.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
