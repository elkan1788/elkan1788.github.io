In addition, recently, Tencent cloud`s ICP filing has started various &amp;ldquo;shameful&amp;rdquo; operations. Once it is found that the domain name resolution IP address is not its cloud service, the ICP filing will be terminated.</description></item><item><title>Use Github, Travis CI to automatically deploy HexoCoding to OSChina Server</title><link>https://lisenhui.cn/en/2017/08/19/use-travis-ci-push-hexo-blog.html</link><pubDate>Sat, 19 Aug 2017 15:40:26 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://lisenhui.cn/en/2017/08/19/use-travis-ci-push-hexo-blog.html</guid><description>&lt;p>Usually we use &amp;lsquo;hexo deploy&amp;rsquo; locally to post blog posts to remote Pages servers, but don&amp;rsquo;t forget that we still need to submit code, so don&amp;rsquo;t feel a bit of trouble and score two steps to do it. Then it occurred to me whether the &amp;lsquo;Travis CI&amp;rsquo; tool could be used to complete the deployment? The answer is yes, and the overall process is roughly as follows:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Edit articles locally (or on the Github website).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Submit an article to the Github server&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Travis CI receives notifications to synchronize the latest Github code and execute user-customized &amp;lsquo;Travis&amp;rsquo; scripts to generate static blogs&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Finally push the generated blog to the specified Pages server&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s just that one of the more troubling questions is how to protect our private keys, and if &amp;lsquo;Travis CI&amp;rsquo; is ready for us, start our journey.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
