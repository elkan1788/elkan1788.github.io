&lt;p>You were born as a programmer and certainly know the importance of backup. Besides, in the context of the current environment, the political relations in the United States are still rather chaotic, and for the projects stored on Github, it is no longer a country of technological freedom. So it&amp;rsquo;s still necessary for our code to have a &amp;ldquo;double&amp;rdquo; backup, and then we&amp;rsquo;ll show you how to use Action on Github to synchronize the code above Github to the Gitee warehouse site in China.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>GitExtensions push Github failed logging</title><link>https://lisenhui.cn/en/2021/02/22/git-extensions-push-fail.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 22 Feb 2021 15:42:39 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://lisenhui.cn/en/2021/02/22/git-extensions-push-fail.html</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="problem-description">Problem Description&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>555, today experienced a &amp;ldquo;pleasure&amp;rdquo; to install the latest program!!!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When you used &lt;strong>GitExtensisons&lt;/strong> to push the latest written article to Github, I encountered an inexplicable error that invalidated SSH KEY authentication. Here&amp;rsquo;s how it happened: Today, when you first open Git Extensions, it&amp;rsquo;s very friendly to pop up the update prompt window, and then you click the confirmation button unconsciously. When the results are updated, an error blocking as magical as the following occurs when pushing the article to Github:&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre style="background-color:#f8f8f8;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4">&lt;code class="language-java" data-lang="java">
FATAL ERROR&lt;span style="color:#666">:&lt;/span> No supported authentication methods &lt;span style="color:#00a000">available&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#666">(&lt;/span>server sent&lt;span style="color:#666">:&lt;/span> publickey&lt;span style="color:#666">)&lt;/span>
&lt;span style="color:#a0a000">fatal:&lt;/span> Could not read from remote repository&lt;span style="color:#666">.&lt;/span>
Please make sure you have the correct access rights
and the repository exists&lt;span style="color:#666">.&lt;/span>
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div></description></item><item><title>Github push failï¼šCould not resolve hostname</title><link>https://lisenhui.cn/en/2017/05/16/github-push-failed.html</link><pubDate>Tue, 16 May 2017 10:21:43 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://lisenhui.cn/en/2017/05/16/github-push-failed.html</guid><description>&lt;p>Usually the most commonly used git push command suddenly can not be used (error log as follows), the brain first jumped out of the idea is: Is Github again by the wall!

&lt;p>Error log returned after git push execution:&lt;/p>

Although learning Git has been for more than a year, but sometimes the less used commands are always a moment to remember. So decided to write it into the blog, not only to share the experience, but also easy to find their own, this blog post will continue to add up. .&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
