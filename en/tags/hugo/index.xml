&lt;p>Use the &lt;code>git extension&lt;/code> graphic tool to publish blog posts to &lt;code>GitHub pages&lt;/code> for netizens to browse.From the perspective of the whole operation process, it&amp;rsquo;s OK. It&amp;rsquo;s just that you have to switch different tool operations in the process, and you happen to see a &lt;a href="https://gohugo.io/tools/editors/#sublime-Text">&lt;strong>plug-in&lt;/strong>&lt;/a> of &lt;code>Sublime Text&lt;/code> on the official website of &lt;code>Hugo&lt;/code>, so I came up with the idea of re integrating the &lt;code>Hugo&lt;/code> use environment, Haha.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Make Hugo NexT theme pithy 2</title><link>https://lisenhui.cn/en/2021/07/09/make-next-theme-pithy2.html</link><pubDate>Fri, 09 Jul 2021 17:53:06 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://lisenhui.cn/en/2021/07/09/make-next-theme-pithy2.html</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="1-background">1.

&lt;p>The &lt;code>NexT&lt;/code> theme has been optimized and shared in GitHub repository since last time [&lt;strong>hugo-theme-next&lt;/strong>]（ &lt;a href="https://github.com/elkan1788/hugo-theme-next">https://github.com/elkan1788/hugo-theme-next&lt;/a> ）After, it has also been used and email feedback by many &lt;code>NexT&lt;/code> theme lovers. So I decided to take some effort to maintain it, so I rejoined some of my previous ideas into the theme of &lt;code>NexT&lt;/code>, and updated the functions of some plug-ins at the same time.
The version code released after this optimization is `3.X', because the overall structure and previous changes are relatively large (mainly reflected in the configuration). Therefore, the relevant introduction of the theme and other information are also rewritten. At present, it is applying to be added to the official theme list (&lt;a href="https://deploy-preview-73--hugothemes.netlify.app/themes/hugo-theme-next/">click preview&lt;/a>), welcome your use and feedback.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Blog Engine Migrates to Hugo Program</title><link>https://lisenhui.cn/en/2020/08/15/blog-move-2-hugo-plan.html</link><pubDate>Sat, 15 Aug 2020 10:22:09 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://lisenhui.cn/en/2020/08/15/blog-move-2-hugo-plan.html</guid><description>&lt;p>Recently found that their personal blog space suddenly ind accessible, after a check found that the original is the previous use of page service providers have stopped providing services. I had no choice but to relocate back to Github Pages. But that&amp;rsquo;s the development environment that&amp;rsquo;s been re-prepared for Hexo, and it&amp;rsquo;s going to take a hard time debugging to be successful. And just then on the Internet have seen Hugo static site engine article, a Go language-based development of the extremely fast framework, development environment deployment is also simple and fast. In addition, the original domain name is also about to expire, just together to organize the blog space.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
