These open source projects on their own impact and inspiration is still very large, have thought before how to give back to the open source community, but also opened some of their own projects, participated in some open source projects, but are still only domestic projects. Not long ago, I saw Jimmy Song in the WeChat Circle of Friends to release the dynamics of the &lt;a href="https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/fPvCU8Dj4c60QMmy_s9rmA">&lt;strong>Istio official website translation team established and volunteer recruitment&lt;/strong>&lt;/a>, without any hesitation, after work contact Jimmy applied to join the translation work, and in the following time to complete his first translation, also successfully merged into the main branch of Theo official warehouse.

&lt;p>You were born as a programmer and certainly know the importance of backup. Besides, in the context of the current environment, the political relations in the United States are still rather chaotic, and for the projects stored on Github, it is no longer a country of technological freedom. So it&amp;rsquo;s still necessary for our code to have a &amp;ldquo;double&amp;rdquo; backup, and then we&amp;rsquo;ll show you how to use Action on Github to synchronize the code above Github to the Gitee warehouse site in China.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>GitExtensions push Github failed logging</title><link>https://lisenhui.cn/en/2021/02/22/git-extensions-push-fail.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 22 Feb 2021 15:42:39 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://lisenhui.cn/en/2021/02/22/git-extensions-push-fail.html</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="problem-description">Problem Description&lt;/h2>

&lt;p>When you used &lt;strong>GitExtensisons&lt;/strong> to push the latest written article to Github, I encountered an inexplicable error that invalidated SSH KEY authentication. Here&amp;rsquo;s how it happened: Today, when you first open Git Extensions, it&amp;rsquo;s very friendly to pop up the update prompt window, and then you click the confirmation button unconsciously. When the results are updated, an error blocking as magical as the following occurs when pushing the article to Github:&lt;/p>

&lt;p>After some consideration or moving your personal blog from the Hexo engine to the Hugo engine, the blog theme is still NexT. In fact, I was worried about tossing up a brand new blog theme, and then I saw the &amp;ldquo;NexT&amp;rdquo;(&lt;a href="https://github.com/xtfly/hugo-theme-next">https://github.com/xtfly/hugo-theme-next&lt;/a>) theme shared by Lanlings on Github and quotedit directly. However, after deployment, there are areas that need to be improved, and the process of retrofitting optimization is documented here.

But this is not very convenient, first of all, layout trouble, second, data modification is more troublesome. Next, let&amp;rsquo;s show you how to implement a list of data using the Table plus Repeater control.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Axure Tutorial : Implementing a dynamic matte layer</title><link>https://lisenhui.cn/en/2017/12/15/axure-lightbox-shade.html</link><pubDate>Fri, 15 Dec 2017 20:22:43 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://lisenhui.cn/en/2017/12/15/axure-lightbox-shade.html</guid><description>&lt;p>Today, while doing product prototyping, I encountered a difficulty with dynamically emerging the matte layer. &amp;ldquo;Helpless&amp;rdquo; in pursuit of high fidelity effect, or spent a little effort to do a prototype to achieve.

&lt;p>On the face of it, the Hive service is functioning normally, the process is running normally, the page UI is normal, and the logs are not output incorrectly. Simple table-building statements can be executed, which can be caused by throwing exceptions when importing local/HDFSdata. The wrong stack information is as follows:&lt;/p>

However, here we mainly only to explain the &amp;lsquo;Python&amp;rsquo; and &amp;lsquo;Java&amp;rsquo;job type tasks, other types of work, such as&amp;rsquo;Commnad&amp;rsquo;,&amp;lsquo;Hive&amp;rsquo;,&amp;lsquo;HadoopShell&amp;rsquo;relatively simple without explanation, if necessary, you can practice ityourself.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Regardless of which task is submitted, &amp;lsquo;Azkaban&amp;rsquo; is managed by uploading a compressed package by default, so it is recommended that you get into the habit ofnot packing the executed files (code) into the &amp;lsquo;Azkaban&amp;rsquo; engineering package. The benefits are obvious, such as:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>The project is created so fast that you don&amp;rsquo;t need to pass on some files to execute&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Avoid modifying the &amp;lsquo;I&amp;rsquo;m max_allow_packet&amp;rsquo;parameterin &amp;lsquo;MySQL&amp;rsquo;to resolve the issue of failed transmissions on engineering files&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>In a distributed environment, when performing Task eliminates the hassle of copying engineering packages in different nodes&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>

&lt;p>In the big data complex ETL or other data processing processes, some tasks need to be performed on a timed basis, although Linux brings itsown&amp;rsquo;cron' commandfunction, but still can not meet the biggest point is that it does notprovide centralized management and visual editing. In fact, in the big data ecology has been integrated with a timed scheduling framework &amp;lsquo;Oozie&amp;rsquo;, but the practice found that its learning costs are not low, the process of distribution is more complex. After trying other distribution worker scheduling frameworks, such as Ali&amp;rsquo;s Zeus &amp;lsquo;Zeus&amp;rsquo;, or &amp;lsquo;Azkaban&amp;rsquo;, which is used by more people in the community.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;lsquo;Azkaban3&amp;rsquo; is still relatively large compared to the changes made in the previous version, and interested parties can be found on its official website, &lt;a href="https://azkaban.github.io/azkaban/docs/latest/">Azkaban&lt;/a>. Next, mainly to share the installation of &amp;lsquo;Azkaban 3&amp;rsquo;, the following is &amp;lsquo;Azkaban 3&amp;rsquo; system architecture design:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="http://myblog.lisenhui.cn/2017/09-08-Azkaban-Install00.png-alias" alt="Azkaban-Install00">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The three components in the figure are an important part of &amp;lsquo;Azkaban3&amp;rsquo;:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>MySQL relationship data storage data&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Web Server GUI management service provider&lt;/li>

Then it occurred to me whether the &amp;lsquo;Travis CI&amp;rsquo; tool could be used to complete the deployment? The answer is yes, and the overall process is roughly as follows:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Edit articles locally (or on the Github website).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Submit an article to the Github server&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Travis CI receives notifications to synchronize the latest Github code and execute user-customized &amp;lsquo;Travis&amp;rsquo; scripts to generate static blogs&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Finally push the generated blog to the specified Pages server&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>

This way in the realization of data add, change, delete function will not be difficult, but in the data query will be troublesome, how to achieve the data without refreshing paging?
I checked what some people did online, but generally found that their code was a bit cumbersome and not in line with my original design.
By looking at the JQUERY API I came up with a feasible solution (now realize some function) : in the query page countless according to first create a table style, through the JQUERY CLONE can work when querying data copy this form style at the same time will pass the data fill the background and remove the line of countless according to the style of the form.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>JQuery+ strusts1.x implements Ajax login without refresh</title><link>https://lisenhui.cn/en/2010/09/05/jquery-ajax-struts1.html</link><pubDate>Sun, 05 Sep 2010 10:11:53 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://lisenhui.cn/en/2010/09/05/jquery-ajax-struts1.html</guid><description>&lt;p>In today&amp;rsquo;s increasingly mature technology development, people not only pursue technological innovation and development, but also pay more attention to the convenience of interaction with users.When programmers are still confused about the issue of data refresh before and after interaction, Ajax came out, it won the majority of programmers with the advantages of convenience and quickness.After a few years of development, it has gradually become an essential tool in our development, I will talk about a Struts1 &amp;lsquo;+&amp;rsquo; Ajax login example.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
