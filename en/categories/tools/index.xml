&lt;p>555, today experienced a &amp;ldquo;pleasure&amp;rdquo; to install the latest program!!!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When you used &lt;strong>GitExtensisons&lt;/strong> to push the latest written article to Github, I encountered an inexplicable error that invalidated SSH KEY authentication. Here&amp;rsquo;s how it happened: Today, when you first open Git Extensions, it&amp;rsquo;s very friendly to pop up the update prompt window, and then you click the confirmation button unconsciously. When the results are updated, an error blocking as magical as the following occurs when pushing the article to Github:&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre style="background-color:#f8f8f8;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4">&lt;code class="language-java" data-lang="java">
FATAL ERROR&lt;span style="color:#666">:&lt;/span> No supported authentication methods &lt;span style="color:#00a000">available&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#666">(&lt;/span>server sent&lt;span style="color:#666">:&lt;/span> publickey&lt;span style="color:#666">)&lt;/span>
&lt;span style="color:#a0a000">fatal:&lt;/span> Could not read from remote repository&lt;span style="color:#666">.&lt;/span>
Please make sure you have the correct access rights
and the repository exists&lt;span style="color:#666">.&lt;/span>
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div></description></item><item><title>APIDoc automatically generates interface documentation</title><link>https://lisenhui.cn/en/2017/07/18/nodejs-apidoc-generator.html</link><pubDate>Tue, 18 Jul 2017 15:23:43 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://lisenhui.cn/en/2017/07/18/nodejs-apidoc-generator.html</guid><description>&lt;p>For the project development common front-end separation mode, the middle in the back end to complete interface development delivery docking, front-end personnel often suffer from no interface documentation will often &amp;ldquo;run away&amp;rdquo; to harass back-end personnel, it is really painful. If there is a documented description at this time it is much easier, now the back-end popular document generation weapon has &amp;lsquo;Swagger&amp;rsquo;, although it is convenient, but also has the disadvantage of writing in the background code, and start the entire background project to access. Perhaps sometimes really not convenient, in addition to the project at the beginning of the interface to do a planning can not use this method, there is no other way?&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>MyEclipse6.5 plus IDE Hanhua software</title><link>https://lisenhui.cn/en/2011/05/16/myeclipse-chinese-tool.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 16 May 2011 13:28:20 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://lisenhui.cn/en/2011/05/16/myeclipse-chinese-tool.html</guid><description>&lt;p>There are millions of languages and words in the world, but always feel that our square Chinese characters are better looking and more meaningful.
