If you enter the domain name directly, an error page of 400 will appear. At the beginning, it took a lot of energy to make the whole site support HTTPS, but I didn&amp;rsquo;t expect this result.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>VirtualBox6.x版本CPU时钟Bug导致虚拟机无法开机</title><link>https://lisenhui.cn/en/2022/04/21/virtualbox6-cup-clock-not-started.html</link><pubDate>Thu, 21 Apr 2022 18:39:47 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://lisenhui.cn/en/2022/04/21/virtualbox6-cup-clock-not-started.html</guid><description>&lt;p>In the afternoon, when I started the commonly used virtual environment, I found that the progress bar would not move for a long time in the middle, which was not normal. In the past, I could see the desktop in 10 minutes at most. Click the direction key on the keyboard to view the printed log. The bug information shown in the following figure is repeated all the time. Even after waiting for more than half an hour to enter the system, the log information is continuously output on the terminal interface.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>SSH login local VM slowly with Mobaxterm</title><link>https://lisenhui.cn/en/2022/04/04/sshlogin-localvm-slowly-mobaxterm.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 04 Apr 2022 11:53:34 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://lisenhui.cn/en/2022/04/04/sshlogin-localvm-slowly-mobaxterm.html</guid><description>&lt;p>Recently, there was a problem with the local virtual machine, but a new environment was rebuilt. As a result, when logging in to the terminal with mobaxterm tool, it was found that you had to wait 4 ~ 5 seconds to enter each time. The operation inspection was not very good. I don&amp;rsquo;t understand why the local environment connection is so slow, so I still have to find a way to analyze it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Some netizens have similar puzzles, suggesting that it may be the reason why they need to address through DNS during SSH login. Refer to the article to find &lt;code>/etc/ssh/sshd_config&lt;/code> sets the &lt;code>UseDNS&lt;/code> configuration item to' no &amp;lsquo;, but it is found that it is closed. What causes that?&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Use Travis CI deploy site by remote command</title><link>https://lisenhui.cn/en/2022/03/22/use-travisci-remote-deploy-site.html</link><pubDate>Tue, 22 Mar 2022 22:13:43 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://lisenhui.cn/en/2022/03/22/use-travisci-remote-deploy-site.html</guid><description>Background Before, I had always hosted my blog site on the GitHub pages service, but the speed of domestic access was really worrying, and sometimes I could not open it, which really affected the experience of visiting and viewing. In addition, recently, Tencent cloud`s ICP filing has started various &amp;ldquo;shameful&amp;rdquo; operations. Once it is found that the domain name resolution IP address is not its cloud service, the ICP filing will be terminated.</description></item><item><title>Use Sublime Text build Hugo blog environment</title><link>https://lisenhui.cn/en/2022/02/12/use-sublime-txt-build-hugo-site.html</link><pubDate>Sat, 12 Feb 2022 16:32:10 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://lisenhui.cn/en/2022/02/12/use-sublime-txt-build-hugo-site.html</guid><description>&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s been a long time since the establishment of &lt;code>Hugo&lt;/code>, but the previous use environment is relatively &lt;strong>&lt;code>Loose&lt;/code>&lt;/strong>, For example, the &lt;code>Sublime Text&lt;/code> text tool is used to edit blog posts, and then call &lt;code>Hugo&lt;/code> through the &lt;code>CMD&lt;/code> command line tool to perform local preview, and finally&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Use the &lt;code>git extension&lt;/code> graphic tool to publish blog posts to &lt;code>GitHub pages&lt;/code> for netizens to browse.From the perspective of the whole operation process, it&amp;rsquo;s OK. It&amp;rsquo;s just that you have to switch different tool operations in the process, and you happen to see a &lt;a href="https://gohugo.io/tools/editors/#sublime-Text" target="_blank" rel="noopener">&lt;strong>plug-in&lt;/strong>&lt;/a>

&lt;p>555, today experienced a &amp;ldquo;pleasure&amp;rdquo; to install the latest program!!!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When you used &lt;strong>GitExtensisons&lt;/strong> to push the latest written article to Github, I encountered an inexplicable error that invalidated SSH KEY authentication. Here&amp;rsquo;s how it happened: Today, when you first open Git Extensions, it&amp;rsquo;s very friendly to pop up the update prompt window, and then you click the confirmation button unconsciously. When the results are updated, an error blocking as magical as the following occurs when pushing the article to Github:&lt;/p>
